<p>This Repository is Created For the reference of my Ongoing course in this semester Natural Language Processing (NLP), This Helps to brush my concepts.</p>
<h><b>Role Of NLP in AI and ML:</b></h>

<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) makes it possible for computers to understand the human language. Behind the scenes, NLP analyzes the grammatical structure of sentences and the individual meaning of words, then uses algorithms to extract meaning and deliver outputs. In other words, it makes sense of human language so that it can automatically perform different tasks.</p>
<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a critical domain within artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. NLP bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding, making it a pivotal area of study and application in AI. Here’s how NLP functions within AI and ML and why it’s so important:</p>

<b>Conclusion:</b>
<p>In AI and ML, NLP serves as a bridge to more intuitive human-machine interactions, enhancing how technology understands and assists in human tasks. It continues to evolve, driven by new research and increasingly sophisticated ML models, expanding the possibilities of what machines can understand and how they can assist in everyday human activities.</p>
